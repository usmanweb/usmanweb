- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Data Scientist in Climate and Health Analytics at NDORMS, University of Oxford. Prior to this, I served as an Assistant Professor and Group Head at the Center for AI Research (CAIR), Beaconhouse National University, where I led research at the intersection of artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and environmental sustainability. I have previously held research roles at the University of Oxford, the University of Leeds, and LUMS, contributing to high-impact projects focused on air pollution mapping, health surveillance, and poverty analysis. My work has been published in leading venues such as The Lancet Planetary Health, and I am a recipient of the Facebook CV4GC Award and the Commonwealth Split-Site PhD Scholarship. I was also nominated for the Times Higher Education (THE) Asia Award for Outstanding Contribution to Environmental Leadership, in recognition of my work on climate resilience, urban risk assessment, and data-driven sustainability initiatives.

- At NDORMS, I am contributing to projects at the intersection of climate and health informatics, leveraging foundation models and Earth observation data to address pressing global challenges.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning socio-economic indicators from remote sensing data.
